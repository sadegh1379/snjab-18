# Typescript React Redux Starter Project

Real World App React / Redux / Typescript Clean and Simple Architecture : Typescript React Redux Starter Project with redux-thunk hooks , fetch api

## Project Details

Build a simple React-Redux application which displays images from cat API. Here's the API :
https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference/images/images-search

Example URL to fetch 10 cats with category hats:
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=10&category_ids=1

Example URL to fetch the categories:
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/categories

The page is a simple app that loads a sidebar (drawer for react native) of all categories and displays 10 cat images in the main display.

* All the categories are clickable - you can click on them and choose a different category
* There is a button to load more cat images at the bottom, which will load 10 more cat
images.
* The app must be built with react-redux
* Don't use any premade UI kit lib, write all styles purely, (StyledComponents library is
highly recommended)
* Aesthetics and clean code are important when building this small prototype.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
